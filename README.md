# Visio app Frontend

This project is the frontend for an opensource visio app based on WebRTC.

This is an early prototype and most of the software isn't created yet.

There will be a backend to control authentication, user profile and signaling, an AWS tool to deploy the app more easily and a Raspberry Pi image to create an visiophone (with OTA update).
